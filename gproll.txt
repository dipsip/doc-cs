Aim: Using unity create 3D Ball Game. 

 

Steps:  

 

 

After logging in : Select 3D template Give project name click on create project 

Plus Symbol below Hierarchy ->Select 3D Object ->Select Plane -> inside inspector window -> give name: Ground 

Plus Symbol below Hierarchy ->Select 3D Object ->Select Sphere -> inside inspector window -> give name: Player -> Position -> change Y value to 0.5 (now the sphere is completely visible) 

 

 

 Click on plus sign below the Project Window -> select Folder -> give name: materials 

Keep the materials folder selected -> again click on plus sign below the Project Window -> select Material -> give name: background 

Inspector window of background -> Main Maps -> Albedo -> select colour of your choice 

 

Then drag the background to the hierarchy -> on the Ground (you can see the colour changes) 

 

 

Select Player -> Add component -> Physics -> Rigidbody 

Select Player -> Add component -> New Script -> give name: PlayerController -> open the script and write code: 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using System.Collections; 

using System.Collections.Generic; 

using UnityEngine; 

 

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour 

{ 

    private Rigidbody rb; 

    public float speed; 

    // Start is called before the first frame update 

    void Start() 

    { 

        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); 

    } 

 

    // Update is called once per frame 

    void FixedUpdate() 

    { 

        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");  

        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical"); 

        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);  

        rb.AddForce(movement*speed); 

 

    } 

} 

 

Inspector window of Player -> go to the end -> change speed to 10 

Test the game (Move using up, down, right & left arrow keys) 

 

 

Select Main Camera -> Inspector window -> and change values  

 

 

 

Select Main Camera -> Inspector window -> New Script -> give name: CameraController -> open the script and write code: 

 

 

using System.Collections; 

using System.Collections.Generic; 

using UnityEngine; 

 

public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour 

{ 

    private Vector3 offset; 

    public GameObject player; 

    // Start is called before the first frame update 

    void Start() 

    { 

        offset = transform.position - player.transform.position; 

    } 

 

    // Update is called once per frame 

    void LateUpdate() 

    { 

        transform.position = player.transform.position + offset; 

    } 

} 

 

Select CameraController -> in Inspector window -> drag the Player from hierarchy inside the Camera Controller Script  

 

 

 

Test the game (You can see the camera focus moving along) 

 

 

Click on plus sign below the Hierarchy -> Create Empty -> rename: Walls 

Click on plus sign below the Hierarchy -> 3D Object -> Cube -> rename: westwall 

Drag westwall inside Walls and change values for westwall 

 

Similarly create for other three walls 

 

 

 

 

eastwall: 

 

 

northwall: 

 

 

southwall: 

 

 

Test the game 

 

 

 

 

Click on plus sign below the Project Window -> select Folder -> give name: prefabs 

Plus Symbol below Hierarchy ->Select 3D Object ->Select Cube -> inside inspector window -> give name: Pickup 

GameObject Tab -> rename: Pickups 

Drag pickup inside pickups 

Now drag pickup to prefabs folder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(uncheck Player) Go to Inspector window of Pickup -> change values 

 

 

 

Add component -> New Script -> name: Rotator and write code: 

 

using System.Collections; 

using System.Collections.Generic; 

using UnityEngine; 

 

public class Rotator : MonoBehaviour 

{ 

    // Start is called before the first frame update 

    void Start() 

    { 

         

    } 

 

    // Update is called once per frame 

    void Update() 

    { 

        transform.Rotate(new Vector3(15, 30, 45) * Time.deltaTime); 

    } 

} 

Save and Test 

Go to Scene -> change from Local to Global 

Make duplicates of Pickup ( Control + D ) 

 

 

 

 

Scene Mode -> Change the direction to top view -> Drag and Drop all the Pickups from hieracrchy 

  

 

 

Enable the Player & test the game 

 

Update PlayerController Script 

 

 

using System.Collections; 

using System.Collections.Generic; 

using UnityEngine; 

using UnityEngine.UI; 

 

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour 

{ 

    public Text winText; 

    public Text countText; 

    public int count; 

    private Rigidbody rb; 

    public float speed; 

    // Start is called before the first frame update 

    void Start() 

    { 

        count = 0; 

        winText.text = ""; 

        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); 

        SetCountText(); 

    } 

 

    // Update is called once per frame 

    void FixedUpdate() 

    { 

        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");  

        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical"); 

        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);  

        rb.AddForce(movement*speed); 

 

    } 

    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) 

    { 

        if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("PickUp")) 

        { 

            other.gameObject.SetActive(false); 

            count = count + 1; 

            SetCountText(); 

        } 

    } 

    void SetCountText() 

    { 

        countText.text = "Count : " + count.ToString(); 

        if (count >= 9) 

        { 

            winText.text = "You win!"; 

        } 

 

    } 

} 

 

 

Prefabs folder -> Select Pickup (so it will be updated for all pickups) -> Add component -> Physics ->  Rigidbody (check ‘Is Trigger’ & ‘Is Kinematic’) 

Scroll Up -> Click on Tag -> Add Tag -> click on pluss sign -> Name: “PickUp” (this name should be same as the name inside the code of PlayerController Script -> inside OnTriggerEnter) -> Save 

Now again Click on Tag -> you can see PickUp option -> Select PickUp 

 

Click on plus sign below Hierarchy -> UI -> text 


Canvas is created -> inside it there is Text -> Rename the text to countText 

Inside inspector window change ‘New Text’ to ‘countText’ 

Change color to yellow  

Select Player -> Then drag the counText from hierarchy to inspector of Player -> PlayerController Script -> inside CountText 


Similarly take one more UI -> name: winText (follow the same steps as for countText) 

 

To add Colors -> Inside materials folder -> create duplicate of background -> give name pickup -> change color through Albedo (green) -> drag this on to each player 

Similarly create duplicate -> rename: player -> change color through Albedo (red) -> drag this on to player 

 

Test the game:
